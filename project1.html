  <h2 class="end">end users</h2>
<p> my end users are people aged 12-16 i will need complex animations and 
  well made controlls to keep the users entertained. they would have to 
  know english to read the text in my game. my game is targeted at teenagers
  because they would have the most interest and they would like the competitive nature
  of my game.

 <p>how the charecter looks is important because the aesthetics will 
  be what sets my low poly charecter apart from all the rest.
 </p>
 <h4>functionality</h4>
 <p>functionality is if it works as intended</p>
 <p>the charecter should not have any problems with the rigging or the 
  animations. to ensure this i will fix any problems that arise as 
  soon as they are found.
 </p>
 <h4>usability</h4>
 <p>usability is about mkaing your project easy to use</p>
 <p>my end users should find my charecter easy to use

  minimal design.
  <h4>intellectual property</h4>
  <p>intellectual property is about not stealing other peoples designs</p>
  <p>my charecter will be oridginal as to not steal anything from anyone else.
