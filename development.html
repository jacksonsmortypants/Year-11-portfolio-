<h2>turnaround</h2>
<p>i drew a turnaround for my low poly charecter i decided to make a robot 
    witch took a while to make.</p>

<h2>testing</h2>
<h2>feedback</h2>
<h3>how could i improve my turnaround, whats wrong with it</h3>
<P>"your design looks very smiple and there is no detail" after this i desided to turn my charecter into a robot. 
    i kept the original shape and body parts but i altered it to turn it more robotic.</P>
<p>"the side view of the head is off center" I kept re-drawing the head untill i was satisfied it was centered.</p>
 <h2>task 1 turnaround</h2>
 <p>my original design was very simple so i restarted giving it much more detail and completely 
    changed the theme.
 </p>
 <h2>task 2 body</h2>
 <p>i made the torso very easly then struggled with the arms and legs. i had so issues with mirroring with had me stuck for a while
    but i eventually fixed the issue and completed the head quickly.
 </p>
 <h2>task 3 armature</h2>
 <p>i was not able to get very far with the armature i ran into a problem and nobody i asked knew how to fix it so i restarted 
    a couple times thinking i did something wrong while adding the armature but the problem persisted and i ran out of time.
