<P>"your design looks very smiple and there is no detail" after this i desided to turn my charecter into a robot. 
    i kept the original shape and body parts but i altered it to turn it more robotic.</P>
<p>"the side view of the head is off center" I kept re-drawing the head untill i was satisfied it was centered.</p>
